phenomena, including city sizes, incomes, word frequencies, and 
earthquake magnitudes, are distributed according to a power-law 
distribution. A power-law implies that small occurrences are extremely 
common, whereas large instances are extremely rare. This regularity or 
'law' is sometimes also referred to as Zipf and sometimes Pareto. To add
 to the confusion, the laws alternately refer to ranked and unranked 
distributions. Here we show that all three terms, Zipf, power-law, and 
Pareto, can refer to the same thing, and how to easily move from the 
ranked to the unranked distributions  and relate their exponents. </font>

A line appears on a log-log plot. 
One hears shouts of "Zipf!","power-law!","Pareto"! Well, which one is 
it? The answer is that it's quite possibly all three. Let's try to 
disentangle some of the confusion surrounding these matters and then tie
 it all back neatly together. 
<p>
All three terms are used to describe phenomena where large events are 
rare, but small ones quite common. For example, there are few large 
earthquakes but many small ones. There are a few mega-cities, but many 
small towns. There are few words, such as 'and' and 'the' that occur 
very frequently, but many which occur rarely. 
</p><p><font color="#ff0000">Zipf's law</font> usually refers to the 'size' <b><i>y</i></b> of an occurrence of an event relative to it's rank <b><i>r</i></b>.
 George Kingsley Zipf, a Harvard linguistics professor, sought to 
determine the 'size' of the 3rd or 8th or 100th most common word. Size 
here denotes the frequency of use of the word in English text, and not 
the length of the word itself. Zipf's law states that the size of the 
r'th largest occurrence of the event is inversely proportional to it's 
rank:<br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>y&nbsp;~&nbsp;r<sup>-b</sup></i></b></font>, with <b><i>b</i></b> close to unity.
</p><p>Pareto was interested in the distribution of income. Instead of asking what the <b><i>r&nbsp;</i></b>th largest income is, he asked how many people have an income greater than <b><i>x</i></b>.  <font color="#ff0000">Pareto's law</font> is given in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF), i.e. the number of events larger than <b><i>x</i></b> is an inverse power of 
<b><i>x</i></b>: 
<br><b><i><font size="+1">P[X &gt; x]&nbsp;~&nbsp;x<sup>-k</sup></font></i></b>.
<br>It states that there are a few multi-billionaires, but most people make only a modest income. 
</p><p>
What is usually called a <font color="#ff0000">power law distribution</font> tells us not how many people had an income greater than <b><i>x</i></b>, but the number of people whose income is exactly <b><i>x</i></b>. It is simply the probability distribution function (PDF) associated with the CDF given by Pareto's Law. This means that <br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>
P[X = x]&nbsp;~&nbsp;x<sup>-(k+1)</sup> = x<sup>-a</sup>.<br>
</i></b></font>
That is the exponent of the power law distribution <b><i>a = 1+k</i></b> (where <b><i>k</i></b> is
the Pareto distribution shape parameter). <br>
See <a href="#ap1">Appendix 1</a> for discussion of Pareto and power-law. 

</p><p>
Although the literature surrounding both the Zipf and Pareto 
distributions is vast, there are very few direct connections made 
between Zipf and Pareto, and when they exist, it is by way of a vague 
reference [1] or an overly complicated mathematical analysis[2,3]. Here I
 show a simple and direct relationship between the two by walking 
through an example using real data. 
</p><p>
Recently, attention has turned to the internet which seems to display 
quite a number of power-law distributions: the number of visits to a 
site [4],  the number of pages within a site [5], and the number of 
links to a page [6], to name a few. My example will be the distribution 
of visits to web sites.
<br>
</p><p> Figure 1a below shows the distribution of AOL users' visits to 
various sites on a December day in 1997. One can observe that a few 
sites get upward of 2000 visitors, whereas most sites got only a few 
visits (70,000 sites received only a single visit). The distribution is 
so extreme that if the full range was shown on the axes, the curve would
 be a perfect L shape. Figure 1b below shows the same plot, but on a 
log-log scale the same distribution shows itself to be linear. This is 
the characteristic signature of a power-law.

</p><p>
Let <b><i> y</i></b> = number of sites that were visited by <b><i>x</i></b> users.<br>
In a power-law we have <b><i>y = C x<sup>-a</sup></i></b>
which means that <b><i>log(y) = log(C) - a log(x)</i></b><br>
So a power-law with exponent <b><i>a</i></b> is seen as a straight line with slope <b><i>-a</i></b> on a log-log plot.
</p><p>
Now one just might be tempted to fit the curve in Fig. 1b to a line to extract the exponent <b><i>a</i></b>.
 A word of caution is in order here. The tail end of the distribution in
 Fig. 1b is 'messy' - there are only a few sites with a large number of 
visitors. For example, the most popular site, Yahoo.com, had 129,641 
visitors, but the next most popular site had only 25,528. Because there 
are so few data points in that range, simply fitting a straight line to 
the data in Fig. 1b gives a slope that is too shallow (a = 1.17). To get
 a proper fit, we need to bin the data into exponentially wider bins 
(they will appear evenly spaced on a log scale) as shown in Fig. 2a. A 
clean linear relationship now extends over 4 decades (1-10<sup>4</sup>) users vs. the earlier 2 decades: (1-100) users. We are now able to extract the correct exponent <b><i>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.07</i></b>.
Rather than binning logarithmically, one can instead look at the Pareto cumulative distribution <b><i><font size="+1">P[X &gt; x]&nbsp;~&nbsp;x<sup>-k</sup></font></i></b>
 to obtain a good fit. The tail naturally smooths out in the cumulative 
distribution and no data is 'obscured' as in the logarithmic binning 
procedure. Fitting the cumulative distribution, we find an exponent of <b><i>a = 2.16</i></b>, quite close to the <b><i>a=2.07</i></b> exponent found with the logarithmic binning procedure (both fits are shown in Figure 2b).</p><p>

</p><p>
So far we have only looked at the power-law PDF of sites visits. In 
order to 
see Zipf's law, we need to plot the number of visitors to each site 
against its rank.  Fig. 3 shows such a plot for the same data set of AOL
 users' site visits. The relationship is nearly linear on a log-log 
plot, and the slope is -1, which makes it Zipf. In order for there to be
 perfectly linear relationship, the most popular sites would have to be 
slightly popular, and the less popular sites slightly more numerous. It 
might be worthwhile to fit this distribution with alternate 
distributions, such as the stretched exponential [7], or parabolic 
fractal [8]. In any case, most would happy to call this rank 
distribution Zipf, and we will call it Zipf here as well.

</p><p> At first, it appears that we have discovered two separate power 
laws, one produced by ranking the variables, the other by looking at the
 frequency distribution.
Some papers even make the mistake of saying so [9]. But the key is to 
formulate the rank distribution in the proper way to see its direct 
relationship to the Pareto. The phrase "The <b><i>r</i></b>&nbsp;th largest city has <b><i>n</i></b> inhabitants" is equivalent to saying "<b><i>r</i></b> cities have <b><i>n</i></b>
 or more inhabitants". This is exactly the definition of the Pareto 
distribution, except the x and y axes are flipped. Whereas for Zipf, <b><i>r</i></b> is on the x-axis and <b><i>n</i></b> is on 
the y-axis, for Pareto, <b><i>r</i></b> is on the y-axis and <b><i>n</i></b> is on the x-axis. Simply inverting the axes, we get that if the rank exponent is <b><i>b</i></b>, i.e. <br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>n ~ r<sup>-b</sup></i></b></font> in Zipf,
<font color="#007000">&nbsp;&nbsp;(n = income, r = rank of person with income n)</font><br>
then the Pareto exponent is <b><i>1/b</i></b> so that <br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>r ~ n<sup>-1/b</sup></i></b></font>
<font color="#007000">&nbsp;&nbsp;(n = income, r = number of people whose income is n or higher)</font>
<br>

(See <a href="#ap2">Appendix 2</a> for details). </p><p>Of course, since the power-law distribution is a direct derivative of Pareto's Law, its exponent is given  by <b><i>(1+1/b)</i></b>.
 This also implies that any process generating an exact Zipf rank 
distribution must have a strictly power-law probability density 
function. As demonstrated with the AOL data, in the case <b><i>b&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</i></b>, the power-law exponent <b><i>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</i></b>. 
</p><p>Finally, instead of touting two separate power-laws, we have 
confirmed that they are different ways of looking at the same thing.

</p><h3><a name="ap1">Appendix 1</a>: The Pareto Distribution</h3>
The Pareto distribution gives the probability that a person's income is greater than or equal to x and is expressed as [10]:<br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>Pr[X &gt;= x] = (m/x)<sup>k</sup>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m &gt; 0, k &gt; 0, x &gt;= m</i></b></font>,<br><br>
where <b><i>m</i></b> represents a minimum income.<br>
As a consequence, the CDF<br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>Pr[X &lt; x] = 1 - (m/x)<sup>k</sup></i></b></font><br><br>
and the PDF is <br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>p<sub>X</sub>(x) = k m<sup>k</sup>x<sup>-(k+1)</sup>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 m &gt; 0, k &gt; 0, x &gt;= m</i></b></font><br>
<br>
Note that the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution, <b><i>k</i></b>, equals <b><i>a-1</i></b>, where <b><i>a</i></b> is the power law slope. Also note that for <b><i>a &lt; 2</i></b> there is no finite mean for the distribution. Presumably because of this, the Pareto distribution is sometimes given with <b><i>k &gt; 1</i></b>, but the <b><i>k &gt; 0</i></b> definition is more widely used.
<p>
Another property, which holds for all <b><i>k</i></b>, not just those <b><i>k</i></b>
 not giving a finite mean, is that the distribution is said to be 
"scale-free", or lacking a "characteristic length scale". This means 
that no matter what range of <b><i>x</i></b> one looks at, the 
proportion of small to large events is the same, i.e., the slope of the 
curve on any section of the log-log plot is the same.

Let the slope of the ranked plot be <b><i>b</i></b>.<br><br> Then the expected value <b><i>E[X<sub>r</sub>&nbsp;]</i></b> of the <i><b>r</b></i>th ranked variable <b><i>X<sub>r</sub></i></b> is given by<br><br>
<font size="+1">
<b><i>E[X<sub>r</sub>&nbsp;] ~ C<sub>1</sub>*r<sup>-b</sup></i></b></font>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>C<sub>1</sub></i></b> a normalization constant,<br><br>
which means that there are <b><i>r</i></b> variables with expected value greater than or equal to <b><i>C<sub>1</sub>*r<sup>-b</sup></i></b>:<br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>P[X &gt;= C<sub>1</sub>*r<sup>-b</sup>] = C<sub>2</sub>*r</i></b></font><br><br>
Changing variables we get:<br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>P[X &gt;= y] ~ y<sup>-(1/b)</sup></i></b></font><br><br>
To get the PDF from the CDF, we take the derivative with respect to 
<b><i>y</i></b>:<br><br>
<font size="+1"><b><i>Pr[X == y] ~ y<sup>-(1+(1/b))</sup> = y<sup>-a</sup></i></b></font>.<br><br>
Which gives the desired correspondence between the two exponents.
